Despite the advantages offered by hierarchical architectures which are offering broad design freedom, this extensive design space also poses significant challenges for inverse designing hierarchical architectures. This paper addresses the inverse design of strain fields for hierarchical architectures by integrating efficient forward prediction with precise inverse optimization. Forward prediction models are developed to accurately predict the physical properties and performance metrics of these materials, while inverse optimization algorithms determine the optimal material distribution to achieve desired outcomes. We propose a machine learning approach that utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based forward prediction model trained on finite element analysis data, achieving over 99% accuracy. An evolutionary algorithm-based inverse optimization model is then used to identify the optimal material configuration to reach the desired strain fields. The results, validated through simulation and experimental testing, demonstrate the potential of machine learning to accelerate the design and optimization of strain fields in hierarchical architectures, paving the way for advanced material applications in the fields of aerospace engineering, biomedical devices, robotics, structural engineering, and energy storage systems.">Abstract</a>

Furthermore, we explore the mechanical properties of the gripper by manipulating parameters such as soft hinge thickness and crease design, establishing a comprehensive relationship between geometric design and mechanical response. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the interplay between bending angle, force–displacement characteristics, and stiffness in the origami grippers.

However, current studies encounter challenges related to insufficient connection strength and suboptimal energy absorption performance. To address these issues, this paper proposed an interlocking negative Poisson’s ratio connector (INPR-Connector) with expansion capabilities and geometric interlocking functions, aimed at enhancing both connectivity and energy absorption. We developed two types of structures: complete structure filling (CSF) and intermediate part filling (IPF), and experimentally validated the superior connection performance and energy absorption capabilities of unit cell-generated structures under various geometric configurations. Moreover, the proposed connection structure was integrated with a rigid plate to create an expandable, bistable origami structure embedded INPR-Connector. When the load is applied, the hinge can store energy through deformation, converting the applied load into tensile forces within the horizontal flexible hinges. This structure can also recover its original shape after multiple cycles of compression, demonstrating excellent load-bearing capacity. Both numerical simulations and physical experiments confirm the effectiveness and feasibility of the designed connection structure within expandable configurations. The results indicate that this structure not only possesses adjustable energy absorption capabilities but also significantly enhances impact resistance.">Abstract</a>

                                data-content="Designing honeycomb structures with exceptional energy absorption capabilities and a broad design space is crucial for meeting the increasing demands in the field of impact protection. In this study, innovative B-spline honeycombs (BSHs) were developed to represent a variety of polyline/curve hexagonal honeycombs. The energy absorption performance of the BSHs was assessed using the finite element method, validated by quasi-static compression experiments. The developed data-driven optimization design framework integrates deep neural network models and genetic algorithms, enabling the generation of novel BSHs that fulfill specific design criteria. Using this framework, the upper specific energy absorption boundary of BSHs was determined to identify configurations with the highest specific energy absorption across varying relative densities. Additionally, empirical equations to compute the maximum initial peaking compression force, mean compression force, and specific energy absorption of BSHs at specific relative densities were summarized. These optimized BSHs were categorized into bowl-shaped BSHs, 30-sided BSHs, 5-shaped BSHs, 2-shaped BSHs, M-shaped BSHs, and r-shaped BSHs based on their topological structures. The BSH with the highest specific energy absorption, 13.4 J/g, belonged to the 5-shaped BSHs category, with a corresponding relative density of 9.15 %. The predominant deformation mode for these optimized BSHs, ensuring maximal material utilization, was identified as perfect folding mode. Compared to traditional hexagonal honeycomb and other polyline/curve hexagonal configurations at equivalent relative densities, the BSHs exhibited superior energy absorption capabilities. This study offers a systematic design approach for future endeavors aimed at developing high energy absorbing honeycombs with more intricate cross-sectional shapes.">Abstract</a>

                                data-content="Metamaterials are artificially synthesized materials whose structures are meticulously designed and precisely controlled to exhibit unique properties not found in natural materials. These functional metamaterials have significant applications in fields such as optics, electromagnetics, acoustics, and mechanics. However, traditional metamaterial design often relies on human expertise, resulting in lengthy design cycles, a lack of flexibility, and limited tunability, which hinder the rapid design and mass production of metamaterials. Efficient design and performance tuning of metamaterials have become crucial research directions in mechanical engineering, and materials science. In recent years, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence algorithms, the application of intelligent algorithms in metamaterial design has been expanding, demonstrating advantages such as efficient optimization, generation of diverse structures, and shortened design cycles. This paper first introduces the basic concepts and development history of meta materials, and then discusses the application fields and design issues of metamaterials from the perspective of practical needs. The paper identifies the core issues of intelligent design algorithms as data representation and dataset construction, providing a detailed explanation and comparative analysis of these two aspects. Additionally, it reviews the framework of intelligent optimization algorithms. Finally, this paper highlights the challenges in metamaterial design, including the scarcity of high-quality datasets, the complexity of multi-objective optimization, and the computational demands of high-resolution metamaterial analysis. Additionally, it explores future trends in the field, emphasizing the development of metamaterials that are “expressible” “editable” “analyzable” “optimizable” and “manufacturable” to address diverse functional requirements.

                                data-content="The forward prediction and inverse design of 4D printing have primarily focused on 2D rectangular surfaces or plates, leaving the challenge of 4D printing parts with arbitrary shapes underexplored. This gap arises from the difficulty of handling varying input sizes in machine learning paradigms. To address this, we propose a novel machine learning-driven approach for forward prediction and inverse design tailored to 4D printed hierarchical architectures with arbitrary shapes. Our method encodes non-rectangular shapes with special identifiers, transforming the design domain into a format suitable for machine learning analysis. Using Residual Networks (ResNet) for forward prediction and evolutionary algorithms (EA) for inverse design, our approach achieves accurate and efficient predictions and designs. The results validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, with the forward prediction model achieving a loss below 0.01, and the inverse optimization model maintaining an error near 1 mm, which is low relative to the entire shape of the optimized model. These outcomes demonstrate the capability of our approach to accurately predict and design complex hierarchical structures in 4D printing applications.">Abstract</a>

                                data-content="Additive manufacturing (AM) has undergone significant development over the past decades, resulting in vast amounts of data that carry valuable information. Numerous research studies have been conducted to extract insights from AM data and utilize it for optimizing various aspects such as the manufacturing process, supply chain, and real-time monitoring. Data integration into proposed digital twin frameworks and the application of machine learning techniques is expected to play pivotal roles in advancing AM in the future. In this paper, we provide an overview of machine learning and digital twin-assisted AM. On one hand, we discuss the research domain and highlight the machine-learning methods utilized in this field, including material analysis, design optimization, process parameter optimization, defect detection and monitoring, and sustainability. On the other hand, we examine the status of digital twin-assisted AM from the current research status to the technical approach and offer insights into future developments and perspectives in this area. This review paper aims to examine present research and development in the convergence of big data, machine learning, and digital twin-assisted AM. Although there are numerous review papers on machine learning for additive manufacturing and others on digital twins for AM, no existing paper has considered how these concepts are intrinsically connected and interrelated. Our paper is the first to integrate the three concepts big data, machine learning, and digital twins and propose a cohesive framework for how they can work together to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and sustainability of AM processes. By exploring latest advancements and applications within these domains, our objective is to emphasize the potential advantages and future possibilities associated with integration of these technologies in AM.">Abstract</a>

The ResNet model exhibits high accuracy, converging to a small error (0.001), as validated across diverse cases. The GA demonstrates effectiveness in achieving optimal or near-optimal solutions, illustrated through case studies shaping parts into a parabola and a sinusoid.

                                data-content="Additive manufacturing is a commonly used manufacturing method in complex part fabrication, instant assemblies, part consolidation, mass customization and personalization, on-demand manufacturing, lightweight, and topological optimization due to its advantage of lower costs, flexibility to learn and use, reduced raw material wastage, digital design integration, high efficiency, environmental-friendliness. However, the current metal 3D printing, which is mainly fabricated layer by layer using laser, is expensive to manufacture metal parts. Therefore, in this paper, a low-cost high-quality metal manufacturing process called low-melting-point alloys (LMPAs) integrated extrusion additive manufacturing will be examined. This manufacturing process can fabricate complex metal structures and integrated circuits with simple fused deposition modeling, which is a cost-effective method for producing these objects. LMPAs with different melting points are used for performance comparison to find out the optimized mechanical behavior, energy absorption properties, and electrical conductivity. Our investigation into LMPAs integrated extrusion additive manufacturing has revealed significant findings. Tensile tests conducted on LMPAs with varying melting points have illuminated distinct mechanical behaviors. Notably, lower melting points contribute to increased ductility but reduced stiffness, while higher melting points result in greater stiffness but diminished ductility. These results emphasize the importance of tailoring LMPA selection based on specific application requirements. Furthermore, our examination of lattice and triply periodic minimal surface structures has demonstrated consistent energy absorption properties across different manufacturing temperatures, highlighting the adaptability and versatility of LMPAs for energy absorption applications. Additionally, our electrical conductivity assessments have shown that LMPAs with melting points of 47°C and 120°C exhibit higher electrical conductivity, making them suitable for applications requiring good electrical conduction properties. These findings collectively underscore the significance of LMPAs in additive manufacturing, offering valuable insights for material selection and applications in various domains.">Abstract</a>

                                data-content="Soft robots are developed and applied in aspects such as grasping delicate objects. Their inherent flexibility also enables applications that are unattainable by humans, especially those in life-threatening environments. However, the object grasping performed by most pneumatic soft robotics during transportation requires continuous external power/force, a highly energy-consuming process, particularly for long-distance transportation. In this paper, we propose a low-melting-point alloy (LMPA)-integrated soft robot, manufactured by material extrusion additive manufacturing, requiring no power/force for holding objects during the moving process and thus presenting energy-saving characteristics. The working principles of the LMPA-integrated soft robot are as follows: (1) The LMPA is injected inside the soft robot using material extrusion. (2) The LMPA is heated to above its melting temperature so that the soft robot can change its shape. (3) At this stage, the soft robot is able to grasp an object. (4) While the soft robot is holding or grasping the object, the LMPA is cooled down to room temperature so that it turns into a solid state, and from this point onward, the soft robot can hold the object without relying on extra power for object grasping. (5) Once the soft robot arrives at the destination, the LMPA will be melted again to change the shape of the soft robot for releasing the grip and/or getting ready for another object grasping. In summary, this paper presents a case study of soft grippers, using 3D printing, specifically material extrusion, for fabricating an LMPA-integrated soft robot.">Abstract</a>

Researchers have been considering how to improve these performances. In this review, we discuss the fundamentals of the LCEs and emphasize the fast actuation strategies developed in recent years. Initially, we introduce conventional preparation strategies. Then, we describe typical actuation mechanisms of LCEs, discussing their features and limitations. Subsequently, we summarize several possible approaches as case studies to enhance the actuation performance of LCEs, including reducing physical sizes, introducing active heating-cooling mechanisms, utilizing mechanical instability, and developing dielectric LCEs. Finally, we discuss the future research opportunities and challenges for rapid actuation of LCEs.">Abstract</a>

                                data-content="Herein, we report a novel hybrid auxetic foam (HAF) with high energy dissipation and self-healing properties prepared by integrating shear thickening gel (STG) with auxetic polyurethane foam (APF). Due to the synergetic action of shear thickening property of STG and the negative Poisson's ratio of APF, HAF shows better impact protection performance than APF and PU foam. The quasi-static compression test shows the energy dissipation ability of HAF is around 4 times that of APF. The dynamic impact test demonstrates that the force reduction of HAF increases by as high as 64 %, compared to APF. Notably, the force reduction improvement of the HAF is much higher than other hybrid auxetic materials. It is also found that the peak force of HAF is reduced as the amount of STG increases. Additionally, the peak force difference between HAF and APF becomes larger when they are subjected to higher impact energies, due to the rate-dependent effect of STG inside the foam. The Poisson's ratio results for HAF with different STG content under low and high compression strain rates reveal that the dimension of auxetic cell structures and STG content are required to be carefully designed to maximize the synergistic effect of auxetic property and shear thickening property. Besides, HAF demonstrates self-healing ability, allowing it to repair damage sustained during use and can be assembled like Lego blocks to make structures with any irregular shapes. Our work provides ideas for the development of advanced auxetic materials, with the potential to revolutionize a wide range of applications.">Abstract</a>
